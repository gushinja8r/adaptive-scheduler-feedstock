  summary: 'An asynchronous scheduler using MPI for Adaptive'
  description: |
    The Adaptive scheduler solves the following problem, you
    need to run a few 100 learners and can use >1k cores. You
    can't use a centrally managed place that is responsible
    for all the workers (like with dask or ipyparallel)
    because >1k cores is too many for them to handle. You
    also don't want to use dask or ipyparallel inside a job
    script because they write job scripts on their own.
    Having a job script that runs code that creates job
    scripts...
    With adaptive-scheduler you only need to define the
    learners and then it takes care of the running
    (and restarting) of the jobs on the cluster.
